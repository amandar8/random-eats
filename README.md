Quarter One Project

For my project I would like to create a program that will allow users to spin a wheel in order to find a random restaurant in their area. Based on a few choices made through a form prior to spinning (they will at the very least set their zip code) will allow the program to fetch restaurants in their area from Zomato’s API. Stretch goals will be to have a form that can dynamically accept multiple preferences; food type, meal time etc.. and return a random restaurant based on those preferences.

Once the user has filled out the form with their location and other preferences, they will be able to push the “Spin to Eat button”. If required preferences, such as location, have not been filled out, the user will be thrown an alert and be required to fill the zip code field. Once the wheel is spun a call will be made to the api based on the users location and restaurants open in the area.

These results will be rendered and another function will run to select a random restaurant. If the user does not like the restaurant they may spin again.  If they do not like the preferences that they have set they can reset the form and begin again.
