Random Eats

Random Eats is a restaurant application that uses the Google places API to retrieve restaurant information based on the users preferences. The user is able to pick a food preference and find a random restaurant or all restaurants in the area based on that food. They also can find all restaurants currently open in the area or all restaurants based on a meal time. (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, or Happy Hour). The user can use the autocomplete search bar within the map to look for restaurants within a different location, neighborhood or anywhere in the world. The current map default is set to downtown Austin.

Future goals will include:
- Linking the user preferences so that you can look for pizza restaurants or restaurants that serve pizza for dinner.

- Defaulting to the users current location when the app is loaded.

- Adding the ability to access a restaurants website directly from the app.


Stretch Goals:

- CRUD Database

- Ability for users to create, update and delete restaurant lists

The application was created with Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. It uses the Google places API to retrieve restaurant information and is mobile friendly.
